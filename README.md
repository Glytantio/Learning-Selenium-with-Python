# Learning-Selenium-with-Python

This repository contains my learning journey with Selenium using Python. It includes practical exercises, example scripts, and notes that demonstrate how to automate browser interactions, handle web elements, and test web applications. The goal is to build a strong foundation in test automation and QA practices.
